## Who?

I am a father, Site Reliability Engineer, and the Sisyphus of tinkering. For work I specialize in monitoring and observability. I am very passionate about SRE tenents, open source software, Linux, music, automation, and breaking stuff until it works.

## What?

This is a blog to help me document any problems, solutions, software, hardware, albums, bands, and discoveries I may find in my internet travels. Some of the things I may write about are:
    - Linux
    - Kubernetes
    - Flux/GitOps
    - NixOS/Nix
    - TrueNAS/ZFS
    - Containers
    - Home Automation
    - Prometheus/Loki/Observability
    - Music
    - Video Games
    - 3D Printing

## Why?

The pursuit of knowledge, the sake of documenting, and the hope that even just one person finds value information or entertainment from my writings.

## How?

This blog is brought to you by a combination of Hugo, Nginx, NixOS, and Akamai Connected Cloud (formerly Linode). You can read about how I set up my blog as a Nix Flake [here](link)
