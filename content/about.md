# Who?

I am a Senior Systems Administrator specializing in monitoring and observability. I am very passionate about SRE tenents, beer, open source software, Linux, music, and my Miata. 

RHCSA-holder. RHCE/CKA/CKAD pursuer. Kubernetes cluster operator. CNCF junkie.

# What?

This is a blog to help me document any problems, solutions, software, hardware, albums, bands, and discoveries I may find in my internet travels. 

# When?

Whenever I feel like it.

# Why?

The pursuit of knowledge, the sake of documenting, and the hope that even just one person finds value or entertainment from my writings.

# How?

This blog is brought to you by a combination of Hugo, Nginx, Helm, Flux, and Kubernetes.
